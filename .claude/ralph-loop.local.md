Review codebase/git and read NIGHTWATCH_V0.1_PLAN.md.  Select a few tasks to move the project forward, only select enough tasks so that the complexity plus effort total of tasks is less than 25.  Complete those tasks, update git with notes/lessons and commit/push and then output on the screen saying I AM xx% done with the total plan
