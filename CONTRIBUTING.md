# Contributing to NIGHTWATCH

Thank you for your interest in NIGHTWATCH! This project is currently in the early design phase, and we welcome feedback, ideas, and contributions from the community.

## Project Status

NIGHTWATCH is an autonomous observatory project that's actively being designed and built. While we're not yet at the stage of accepting large code contributions, there are many ways to get involved.

## How You Can Help

### Share Your Expertise

We'd particularly love to hear from you if you have experience with:

- **OnStepX Development** — Configuration, tuning, or custom features
- **Harmonic Drive Mounts** — Design, machining, or assembly experience
- **Astrophotography Automation** — ASCOM/INDI integration, automated imaging sequences
- **Edge AI / Local Inference** — Whisper, Piper, or similar models on embedded hardware
- **Russian Optics** — Experience with Intes Micro or similar Maksutov-Newtonian designs
- **Remote Observatory Operations** — Lessons learned, safety systems, enclosure automation
- **Weather Monitoring** — Ecowitt, AAG CloudWatcher, or similar integration

### Provide Feedback

- **Open an Issue** for questions, suggestions, or concerns
- **Start a Discussion** for broader topics or ideas
- Review the [Build Package](NIGHTWATCH_Build_Package.md) and share thoughts on the design

### Report Problems

If you spot errors in documentation, code issues, or have concerns about the design:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Open a new issue with a clear description
3. Include relevant context (component, section, etc.)

## Code Contributions

For code contributions (once we reach that stage):

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your changes
3. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages
4. **Test** your changes where applicable
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with a description of what and why

### Code Style

- Python code should follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Communication

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intentions
- Focus on the technical merits of ideas
