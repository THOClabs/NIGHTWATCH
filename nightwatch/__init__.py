A fully autonomous, voice-controlled telescope observatory running entirely
on-premise with local AI processing. No cloud dependencies.

Architecture:
    - Local-first: All AI/voice/control processing on DGX Spark
    - Modular microservices: ASCOM Alpaca, Wyoming protocol, OnStepX, INDI
    - Safety-first: Environmental interlocks via safety_monitor
    - Expert-driven: POS methodology for novel decisions
