"""
NIGHTWATCH Test Fixtures Package.

Provides mock implementations of observatory services for testing.
These fixtures enable unit and integration testing without requiring
actual hardware connections.

Available fixtures:
- MockMount: Simulates mount controller (LX200/OnStepX)
- MockWeather: Simulates weather service (Ecowitt)
- MockCamera: Simulates camera controller (ZWO ASI)
- MockGuider: Simulates guiding service (PHD2)
- MockFocuser: Simulates focus controller
- MockEnclosure: Simulates roll-off roof/dome
- MockPower: Simulates UPS/PDU power monitoring
- MockLLM: Simulates local LLM inference
- MockSTT: Simulates speech-to-text (Whisper)
- MockTTS: Simulates text-to-speech (Piper)

Usage:
    from tests.fixtures import MockMount, MockWeather

    async def test_slew():
        mount = MockMount()
        await mount.connect()
        await mount.slew_to_coordinates(12.5, 45.0)
        assert mount.is_slewing
