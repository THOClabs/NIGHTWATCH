## Versioning Policy

NIGHTWATCH follows semantic versioning:

- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, architecture overhauls
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, documentation updates

## Contributing to the Roadmap

Have ideas for NIGHTWATCH? We welcome input:

1. **Feature Requests**: Open a GitHub issue with the "enhancement" label
2. **Discussions**: Join roadmap discussions in GitHub Discussions
3. **Pull Requests**: Contribute implementations for roadmap items

## Principles

All development follows NIGHTWATCH core principles:

1. **Local-First**: No required cloud dependencies
2. **Safety-First**: Environmental interlocks are non-negotiable
3. **Voice-Native**: All features accessible via voice
4. **Open Standards**: ASCOM, INDI, Wyoming compatibility
5. **Non-Commercial**: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license
