# Intes and Intes Micro: A History of Russian Maksutov-Newtonian Telescopes

This document provides historical context and technical background on the Intes and Intes Micro telescope manufacturers, with particular focus on the Maksutov-Newtonian product line and the rationale for selecting the MN78 for the NIGHTWATCH project.

## Company Origins

### Cold War Heritage

Intes and Intes Micro trace their origins to the Soviet-era defense optics industry. During the Cold War, virtually unlimited R&D spending established an optical industry using cutting-edge technology for production and testing of imaging surfaces. These facilities produced high-technology optics for Russian military applications—both ground-based and space-based systems.

Following the dissolution of the USSR, the severe economic recession created interest in selling precision telescopes into Western consumer markets. The skilled engineers and technicians who had produced military and scientific optics turned their expertise toward amateur astronomy equipment.

### Intes (1991)

The **Intes manufacturing co-operative** was founded in Moscow in 1991 by a group of engineers and technicians from the defense optics sector. The company initially produced Maksutov-Cassegrain and Maksutov-Newtonian telescopes under the Intes name.

Key characteristics of original Intes instruments:
- Moving-mirror focusing system
- Simple MgF antireflection coatings on early corrector plates
- 91% reflectivity mirror coatings
- Optical quality minimum of 1/4 to 1/6 wave P-V irregularity
- Interferometrically tested in autocollimation

### Intes Micro (Split)

**Intes Micro** was formed by former Intes employees as a separate company, also based in Moscow. While the exact date of the split is not precisely documented, Intes Micro emerged in the mid-1990s and eventually became the dominant brand in Western markets.

Intes Micro introduced several refinements:
- Lighter optical tube assemblies
- Higher reflectivity mirror coatings (95% vs. 91%)
- Upgraded broadband antireflection coatings
- Improved knife-edge baffling
- Better focuser designs

### The Intes-Alter Premium Division

The **Intes-Alter** (or simply "Alter") designation indicated premium-grade instruments featuring:
- Exotic mirror substrates: Astrositall (Sitall CO-115M) or fused silica
- Enhanced optical testing and quality control
- 1/8 to 1/10 wave P-V surface accuracy
- Premium mechanical components

### Western Distribution

APM Telescopes GmbH, founded by Markus Ludes in Germany, became the primary Western distributor in the late 1990s. Other vendors included:
- Stellar Optical Corporation (USA)
- ENS Optical (UK)
- Widescreen Centre (UK)
- Orion Telescopes (sold the MN61 as the "Argonaut")

APM also offered premium configurations with German-machined tubes (by Matthias Wirth) and Starlight Instruments Feather Touch focusers.

## The Maksutov-Newtonian Design

### Optical Advantages

The Maksutov-Newtonian combines a spherical primary mirror with a thick meniscus corrector lens to achieve:

| Characteristic | Benefit |
|----------------|---------|
| **Small central obstruction** | 13-24% vs. 30-40% for SCTs; preserves contrast and resolution |
| **No spider vanes** | Eliminates diffraction spikes; improves micro-contrast |
| **Sealed tube** | Reduces tube currents; protects optics from contamination |
| **Low coma** | 1/4 the coma of a standard Newtonian; sharper field edges |
| **Spherical optics** | Easier to manufacture to high precision |

These characteristics earned Russian Mak-Newts a reputation for "refractor-like" views—high contrast, pinpoint stars, and exceptional planetary detail at a fraction of the cost of equivalent aperture apochromatic refractors.

### Thermal Considerations

Premium Intes Micro instruments offered **Astrositall** (Russian glass-ceramic) mirror substrates. Astrositall has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of only **0 ± 1.5×10⁻⁷ °C⁻¹** in the range -60°C to +60°C, comparable to Zerodur and fused silica. This near-zero expansion ensures the mirror maintains its optical figure across temperature changes—critical for an unattended observatory like NIGHTWATCH that experiences significant diurnal temperature swings.

## Why the MN78 for NIGHTWATCH

The NIGHTWATCH project selected the **Intes Micro MN78** (178mm f/8) based on the following technical considerations:

### 1. Central Obstruction

At **13.4%** by diameter, the MN78 has one of the smallest central obstructions available in any reflecting telescope of this aperture class. For comparison:

| Telescope Type | Typical CO% |
|----------------|-------------|
| Schmidt-Cassegrain (8") | 34-37% |
| Maksutov-Cassegrain (7") | 25-30% |
| Standard Newtonian (8") | 20-25% |
| **MN78** | **13.4%** |
| Apochromatic Refractor | 0% |

This small obstruction preserves the energy in the central Airy disk and minimizes light scattered into the diffraction rings, yielding contrast performance approaching that of an unobstructed 7" apochromat.

### 2. Planetary and Lunar Performance

The f/8 focal ratio optimizes the MN78 for high-magnification planetary and lunar observation—NIGHTWATCH's primary imaging targets. User reports consistently describe the MN78 as a "planet killer" that matches or exceeds the performance of premium APO refractors on Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars.

### 3. Thermal Stability

The sealed tube design and availability of Astrositall or fused silica mirror substrates provide excellent thermal stability:
- Closed tube eliminates convective tube currents
- Near-zero CTE substrates maintain optical figure
- Built-in 12V cooling fan accelerates thermal equilibration

For an autonomous Nevada installation with 30-40°F diurnal temperature swings, thermal stability is essential.

### 4. No Diffraction Spikes

The secondary mirror is mounted directly to the meniscus corrector—no spider vanes. This eliminates the characteristic 4- or 6-pointed diffraction spikes of conventional Newtonians, improving micro-contrast and simplifying image processing.

### 5. Manageable Size

At 14 kg and approximately 1400mm tube length, the MN78 is compatible with the NIGHTWATCH harmonic drive mount design (25 kg payload capacity). The f/8 focal ratio provides 1440mm focal length in a relatively compact package.

### 6. Optical Quality Heritage

Intes Micro instruments were interferometrically tested to 1/6 to 1/10 wave P-V standards—quality levels typically associated with premium APO refractors or research-grade optics.

## Decline of Production

### Intes Closure (~2004)

The original Intes company ceased telescope production around 2004, reportedly due to competitive pressure from Intes Micro, which had captured the majority of the Western market.

### Intes Micro Closure (2018)

Intes Micro ceased production in **2018** following the retirement of the head optical technician after a period of ill health. This information was confirmed by Dr. Simon Bennett of the Widescreen Centre (UK).

Additional factors contributed to the end of Russian amateur telescope production:
- Russian government policy redirecting optical laboratories toward military and industrial output
- Similar restrictions affected LZOS objectives and TAL telescopes
- Complex export logistics from Russia
- Aging workforce without succession planning

### End of an Era

The closure of Intes Micro marked the end of a remarkable 25+ year production run of premium Maksutov telescopes. No current manufacturer produces Maksutov-Newtonians of comparable quality, making these instruments highly sought-after on the used market.
