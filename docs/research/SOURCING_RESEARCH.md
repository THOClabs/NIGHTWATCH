## 1. Intes-Micro MN76 Telescope Sourcing

### Status: ACTIVE SEARCH REQUIRED — RARE VINTAGE OPTIC

#### Model Clarification

The target OTA is the **Intes Micro MN76** (178 mm f/6 Maksutov-Newtonian). This model is frequently listed as "MN78" in classifieds and dealer catalogs due to historical naming inconsistencies—both designations refer to the same 178mm aperture, ~1068mm focal length instrument. When searching, use both model numbers to maximize coverage.

#### Why This Optic Remains Ideal

Despite Intes-Micro ceasing production (the company wound down operations in the mid-2010s following the founder's passing), the MN76/MN78 remains one of the finest planetary instruments ever produced for amateur astronomers:

- **Exceptional optical quality:** Hand-figured Russian optics routinely tested at 1/8 wave or better. The Mak-Newt design eliminates coma while maintaining a fast f/6 focal ratio ideal for lucky imaging.
- **Closed tube design:** Critical for harsh environments like Nevada's high desert. The sealed tube eliminates thermal currents from the primary mirror and protects optics from dust, insects, and moisture.
- **Low central obstruction:** At ~25% by diameter, significantly smaller than SCTs (33-35%), yielding superior contrast transfer at planetary spatial frequencies.
- **Thermal stability:** The full-aperture meniscus corrector acts as a thermal buffer, reducing tube currents even during rapid temperature swings.

No current production Mak-Newt offers this combination of aperture, optical quality, and environmental resilience at any price point.

#### Rarity and Search Strategy

The MN76/MN78 appears on the used market infrequently—expect to monitor listings for several months before a specimen surfaces. When one does appear, act quickly; these instruments typically sell within days.

**Recommended Search Terms:**
- "Intes Micro MN76"
- "Intes Micro MN78"
- "Intes MN76"
- "Intes MN78"
- "178mm Mak-Newt"
- "178mm Maksutov-Newtonian"
- "7 inch Maksutov Newtonian"

**Primary Search Venues:**

| Venue | URL | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Astromart Classifieds** | https://astromart.com | Best US source; set email alerts |
| **Cloudy Nights Classifieds** | https://cloudynights.com/classifieds | Active community, good prices |
| **eBay (worldwide)** | https://ebay.com | Use saved searches with alerts |
| **European Markets** | Various | Higher availability in EU/UK |
| **APM Telescopes Germany** | https://www.apm-telescopes.net | May have old stock or leads |
| **Teleskop-Service Germany** | https://teleskop-service.de | European dealer network |
| **Russian astronomy forums** | Various | Requires translation; rare finds |

**European Considerations:**
European markets (Germany, UK, Eastern Europe) often have better MN76/MN78 availability due to proximity to the original Russian production. Factor in shipping (~$150-300) and potential import duties (2.5% for optical instruments) when budgeting.

#### Pricing Estimates

| Condition | Price Range (USD) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Used (excellent) | $1,500 - $2,200 | Most likely acquisition path |
| Used (good, needs cleaning) | $1,000 - $1,500 | May need corrector coating service |
| NOS/mint (rare) | $2,500 - $3,500 | Occasionally surfaces from estates |
| APM/Wirth premium (historical) | $3,500 - $5,000 | Custom German tube builds, extremely rare |

#### Alternative OTAs (If MN76 Unavailable)

If extended searching fails to locate an MN76/MN78, consider these alternatives in order of preference:

1. **Intes-Micro MN86** (8" f/6, ~203mm)
   - Larger aperture, same optical design philosophy
   - Heavier (~12 kg), may require mount capacity upgrade
   - Even rarer than MN76; higher prices when found
   - Estimated: $2,500 - $3,500 used

2. **Intes-Micro MN66** (6" f/6, ~152mm)
   - Same excellent optics in smaller package
   - More frequently available
   - Lighter (~6 kg), easier to balance
   - Historical price: $1,295 new; $800-$1,200 used
   - Good fallback if payload capacity is a concern

3. **APM/LZOS 180mm f/8 Mak-Newt**
   - Modern production using premium Russian LZOS optics
   - Slower focal ratio (f/8 vs f/6)
   - Higher cost (~$4,000-5,000 new)
   - Contact APM Telescopes for availability

4. **Explore Scientific MN-152** (6" Mak-Newt)
   - Currently in production, readily available
   - Mass-produced (less consistent QC than Intes)
   - Budget option: ~$700-900 new
   - Acceptable if vintage optics cannot be sourced
